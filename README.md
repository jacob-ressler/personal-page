This is my first real web development project, so there is a fair bit of experimentation and (probably) unconventional code. Regardless, I think it came together well and am generally pleased with how it has turned out. I will continue to work on this interspersedly and as I see necessary.

## Regarding usage...

As the project license implies, all source code is free to be used or modified for your own projects as you see fit. As for the images, ones like those used for my project tiles and hero image are courtesy of [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and either unlicensed or protected by a free-use non-attribution license. Those images are not owned by me. 

However, the images used for the About Me carousels are mine. You can use them if you want, but I will definitely judge you for it 'cause that's kinda weird.
